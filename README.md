# Nepali Romanized Pro (Unicode) for OSX


This is a package that installs Unicode Nepali Romanized Keyboard Layout on a Mac OSX machine. Since the Keyboard Layout that comes with OSX is pretty much limited and of Traditional type, this is supposed to be a replacement for a much better experience. As easy as 3 steps.

This keyboard layout is based on the Nepali Unicode Romanized layout by Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya.


## Installation

Download the [latest version here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/nepaliromanizedpro-osx/files/Nepali-Romanized-Pro-2.0-20140107.mpkg.zip/download), unzip it and run the installer. You have to log out before being able to use the Keyboard Layout.
