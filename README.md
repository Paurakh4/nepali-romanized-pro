# Nepali Romanized Pro ( Unicode )


This is an package that installs Unicode Nepali Romanized Keyboard Layout on a Mac OSX machine. Since the Keyboard Layout that comes with OSX is pretty much limited and of Traditional type, this is supposed to be a replacement for a much better experience. As easy as 3 steps.

This keyboard layout is based on the Nepali Unicode Romanized layout by Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya.


## Installation

Download the [latest version here](https://github.com/suvash/nepali-romanized-pro/downloads), unzip it and run the installer.Sadly enough, you have to restart in order to use the Keyboard Layout.


## Usage

After installing and restarting your Mac(this is necessary else it won't work.), follow as below.
![System Preferences]()

Open "Language & Text" in the System Preferences (in Mountain Lion). (under similar name in older version of OSX)

In the "Input Source" tab, scroll down to find "Nepali Romanized Pro". Enable it. Make sure you also enable the "Show input in menu bar"

On the menubar, select the keyboard layout you want to use.

### That's it. You're all set to using Nepali on you machine.
