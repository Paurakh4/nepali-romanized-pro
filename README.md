# Nepali Romanized Pro (Unicode) for macOS


This is a package that installs Unicode Nepali Romanized Keyboard Layout on a macOS machine. Since the Keyboard Layout that comes with macOS is limited, this is intended to be a replacement for a better experience.

This keyboard layout is based on the Nepali Unicode Romanized layout by Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya.


## Installation

The package is not signed yet, so you will have to right-click open, and allow the package to run.


- Download the latest version [from releases](https://github.com/suvash/nepali-romanized-pro/releases).
- Right-click on the package, choose 'Open'. Read the warning and continue to open the package instead of moving it to the bin. The package will be signed in a future release to solve this issue.

You have to log out, and the log back in before being able to use the Keyboard Layout.
