# Nepali Romanized Pro (Unicode) for OSX


This is a package that installs Unicode Nepali Romanized Keyboard Layout on a Mac OSX machine. Since the Keyboard Layout that comes with OSX is pretty much limited and of Traditional type, this is supposed to be a replacement for a much better experience. As easy as 3 steps.

This keyboard layout is based on the Nepali Unicode Romanized layout by Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya.


## Installation

Download the [latest version here](https://github.com/downloads/suvash/nepali-romanized-pro/Nepali-Romanized-Pro_1.3.zip), unzip it and run the installer. Sadly enough, you have to restart in order to use the Keyboard Layout.

## Usage

After installing and restarting your Mac(this is necessary else it won't work.), follow as below.

Open "Language & Text" in the System Preferences (in Mountain Lion). (under similar name in older version of OSX)
